## About HCI /depot

The HCI Capstone Inspiration /depot *(HCI/d : get it?)* is a digital library showcasing past capstone projects completed by second-year graduate students in the [Human-Computer Interaction design (HCI/d) program](https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/ms-hci.html) at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html). These projects are part of the I695 HCI/d Capstone Thesis course, which students take during their final semester. Currently, there is no centralized archive for these projects, and this collection is being built to fill that gap by providing easy access to digitized versions of posters, project documentation, and design prototypes.
