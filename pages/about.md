## About HCI /depot

The HCI Capstone Inspiration /depot *(HCI/d : get it?)* is the official digital archive of capstone projects from the [Human-Computer Interaction design (HCI/d) program](https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/ms-hci.html) at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html).

It showcases the work of second-year graduate students completing their final semester project in the I695 HCI/d Capstone Thesis course. This archive provides a centralized, accessible collection of capstone posters, project documentation, design prototypes, and more — making it easy to explore the breadth of work produced by HCI/d cohorts over the years.

For a more detailed look at the archive, its purpose, and how it’s structured, check out the sections below:

### Contact

HCI /depot was created by [Akanksha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayheyakanksha/), an MS HCI/d student (Class of 2025), as a digital archive for the HCI/d program at Indiana University Bloomington. The project originally began as part of the [Z652 Digital Libraries](https://jawalsh.github.io/z652-Digital-Libraries-FA24/) course in Fall 2024, taught by [Professor John A. Walsh](https://jawalsh.github.io/), and has since grown into the official capstone archive for the program.
