## About HCI /depot

The HCI Capstone Inspiration /depot *(HCI/d : get it?)* is a digital library showcasing past capstone projects completed by second-year graduate students in the [Human-Computer Interaction/design (HCI/d) program](https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/ms-hci.html) at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html). These projects are part of the I695 HCI/d Capstone Thesis course, which students take during their final semester. Currently, there is no centralized archive for these projects, and this collection aims to fill that gap by providing easy access to digitized versions of posters, project documentation, and design prototypes.

## People

This collection was created by [Akanksha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayheyakanksha/), a second-year MS HCI/d student (Class of 2025). The project was developed as part of the Z652 Digital Libraries course, taught by [Professor A. John Walsh](https://jawalsh.github.io/). Special thanks to [Professor Colin M Gray](https://colingray.me/) for their invaluable support and guidance in bringing this idea to life.
