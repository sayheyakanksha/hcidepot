## Creator

### Akanksha

[Akanksha (she/her)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayheyakanksha/) is a second-year master’s student (Class of 2025) in the [Human-Computer Interaction design (HCI/d) program](https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/ms-hci.html) at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html). After spending way too much time searching for inspiration and past examples for her own capstone, she decided to build the kind of resource she *wished* she had — something to make things easier (and less stressful!) for future students.

## Special Thanks

A huge thank-you to all the HCI/d students who gave permission to showcase their amazing capstone work in this collection. This site wouldn’t be possible without their creativity, time, and generosity.

And a heartfelt thanks to the [CollectionBuilder team](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/about.html#people) for developing such a powerful and user-friendly tool — and for always being there to help in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/CollectionBuilder/discussions). You're awesome!
