## Creator

### Akanksha

[Akanksha (she/her)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayheyakanksha/) is a second-year master’s student (Class of 2025) in the [Human-Computer Interaction design (HCI/d) program](https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/ms-hci.html) at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html). She grew tired of searching for resources to help decide what to focus on for her own capstone project, so she built this collection to make things easier for others going through the same process.
