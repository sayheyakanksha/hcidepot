## Documentation for HCI /depot

The PDF document below provides information on the context, content, intended users, and functional requirements, along with all essential components of a metadata application profile (MAP) designed for this HCI /depot collection. It includes element names, Dublin Core mappings, obligations, cardinalities, input guidelines, and applicable controlled vocabularies or syntax schemas. Examples and detailed explanations are provided for added clarity.

You can also view this project's MAP in a table format here: [metadata application profile](metadata-profile.html).
