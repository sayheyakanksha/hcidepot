## About I695 Capstone Thesis Course

The I695 Capstone Thesis Course represents the conclusion of the professional Master's of HCI/d program at Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering.

Students pursue their own independent projects scaffolded by the course, their peers and the teaching team (2/3 faculty members and 2/3 associate instructors). The capstone is each student's opportunity ro show themselves, their peers, and potential employers what they can do. The HCI /depot digital capstone collection is part of the culmination of their efforts.

Students choose from one of the four types of projects: [*Interaction Design*](#interaction-design), [*User Research for Design*](#user-research-for-design), [*Service Design*](#service-design), or [*Academic Research*](#academic-research). Methods overlap considerably across all four types. The final deliverables determine which type a student has completed.

#### Interaction Design
Culminates in the development, proposal, evaluation of an interactive artifact. Along with other process documentation, students deliver an interactive prototype.

#### User Research for Design 
Emphasizes user experience research, including the design and execution of one or more user studies, data analysis, and synthesis in the forms of implications for design and ten design concepts informed by results.

#### Service Design 
Culminates in the development and proposal of a service, which is an organized system that provides for or accommodates a need and may contain many products. Along with other process documentation, students also deliver service blueprints and customer journey maps.

#### Academic Research
Culminates in a novel scientific contribution expressed in a publishable paper. It consists of a rigorous literature review, study design, presentation of results and well-considered implications for the research community.
