## Technical Details

This digital library is made using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) which is an an open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.

This websites is built using one of their templates, called [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/csv/) which is their most robust and flexible "stand alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll and a metadata CSV.

See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.

### Design

The HCI/d logo is featured to reflect that the capstone projects showcased in this archive were created by students in the Human-Computer Interaction design (HCI/d) program at IU.

This website primarily follows [Indiana University Bloomington's](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html) brand color scheme, as outlined on the [official colors page](https://www.iu.edu/brand/design/color.html). The main colors are also presented in a [Coolors](https://coolors.co/palette/990000-243142-ffffff-006298-800000) palette for quick reference.

The site's typography aims to follow IU's official typeface, Benton Sans, as specified on the [official typography page](https://www.iu.edu/brand/design/typography/index.html).
